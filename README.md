=======

This is a custom fork of https://github.com/jitsi/jidesha where the following changes have been made:

- Added a configuration panel where you can customize:
1) Jitsi instance URL
2) Button labels
3) Invitation message inserted in the calendar event description
4) 
- Customization of the room based on the text entered in the event title, if the title is empty and the button is clicked first a random name is added for the room
